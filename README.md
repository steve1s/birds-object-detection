# Birds Object Detection

This project focuses on detecting various bird species in images using deep learning techniques. It leverages state-of-the-art object detection models (likely YOLO-based) to identify and classify birds in diverse environments.

## Features

- Object detection for various bird species
- YOLO-based model architecture
- Custom dataset support
- Training and evaluation scripts
- Inference on images or videos
- Visual output with bounding boxes
